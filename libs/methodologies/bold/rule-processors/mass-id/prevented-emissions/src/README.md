# BOLD Carbon CHâ‚„ â€“ [PREVENTED_EMISSIONS_BY_MATERIAL_AND_BASELINE_PER_TON](./prevented-emissions.constants.ts)

This constant file provides precomputed baseline methane emissions for organic waste disposal scenarios as defined in the **BOLD Carbon CHâ‚„ Methodology**.

## ðŸ“˜ Context

When calculating prevented emissions for composting projects, it is essential to compare each material's potential emissions under traditional waste disposal scenarios. These reference scenarios (baselines) are:

- **Landfills with flaring of methane gas (and/or capture of biogas)**
- **Landfills without methane flaring**
- **Open-air dumps**

Each organic waste subtype is assigned emission factors (in **tons of COâ‚‚e per ton of waste**) based on default values and decay models aligned with **AMS-III.F v12.0** and IPCC standards.

## ðŸ§ª Source Model

The emission factors were generated using the official Carrot calculator.
