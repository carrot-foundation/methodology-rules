# BOLD Carbon CH₄ – Baseline Emission Factors

This module provides precomputed baseline methane emissions for organic waste disposal scenarios as defined in the **BOLD Carbon CH₄ Methodology**.

## 📘 Context

When calculating avoided emissions for composting projects, it is essential to compare each material's potential emissions under traditional waste disposal scenarios. These reference scenarios (baselines) are:

- **Landfills with methane flaring**
- **Landfills without methane flaring**
- **Open-air dumps**

Each organic waste category is assigned emission factors (in **tons of CO₂e per ton of waste**) based on default values and decay models aligned with **AMS-III.F v12.0** and IPCC standards.

## 🧪 Source Model

The emission factors were generated using the official Carrot calculator.
