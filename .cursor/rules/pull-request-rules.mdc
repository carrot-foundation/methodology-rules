# Pull Request Description Guidelines

When creating PR descriptions, follow these guidelines to ensure consistency and clarity:

## Template Structure

Always use the template from @`.github/pull_request_template.md` which includes:

- Summary
- Details
- Related links
- Declaration checkbox

## Writing Guidelines

### Summary Section

The summary should:

- Be concise (1-3 sentences)
- Start with an action verb (Updates, Adds, Fixes, etc.)
- Clearly state the main purpose of the changes
- Use present tense
- Not include implementation details

Example:

```markdown
Updates the rule creation script command name and improves its documentation for better clarity and maintainability.
```

### Details Section

Structure the details as:

1. **Main Changes List**:

   - Use bullet points or numbered lists
   - Group related changes
   - Include before/after examples for significant changes
   - Highlight breaking changes if any

2. **Technical Details** (if applicable):
   - File structure changes
   - Configuration updates
   - Dependencies modified
   - Performance implications

Example:

```markdown
The changes include:

1. **Command Name Update**:

   - Changed `old-command` to `new-command`
   - Updated all examples and documentation

2. **Configuration Changes**:
   - Added new options in `config.json`
   - Updated default values
```

### Related Links Section

Include when applicable:

- Notion documentation links
- ClickUp task links
- Related PRs
- External references

If no related links exist, use "N/A"

### Declaration Checkbox

Always check the declaration checkbox when creating PR descriptions, confirming:

- The changes work as expected
- No services are broken
- Best practices were followed
- Code quality has improved

## Creating Pull Requests

### Using GitHub CLI

After creating the PR description in a file named `pr_description.md`, use the GitHub CLI to create the pull request with the following command:

```bash
gh pr create \
  -a @me \                           # Assign PR to yourself
  -r @carrot-foundation/developers \ # Request review from the developers team
  --label feature \                  # Add appropriate labels
  -F pr_description.md \             # Use the generated PR description file
  -R carrot-foundation/methodology-rules \ # Specify the target repository
  --repo carrot-foundation/methodology-rules \ # Specify where to push the branch
  -t "Your PR title here"            # Specify the PR title (use the commit message)
```

Note:
- The `-R` flag specifies the target repository in the format `owner/repo`
- The `--repo` flag specifies where to push the branch, also in the format `owner/repo`
- Both flags are required to make the command fully non-interactive

### Steps for AI Agent

1. Create the PR description following the template and guidelines above
2. Save the PR description to a temporary file named `pr_description.md`
3. Execute the gh CLI command to create the PR
4. Clean up the temporary description file after PR creation

### Labels

Use appropriate labels based on the PR type:
- `feature` for new features
- `bug` for bug fixes
- `chore` for maintenance tasks
- `docs` for documentation updates
- `refactoring` for refactoring changes

## Special Cases

### Breaking Changes

When the PR includes breaking changes:

1. Highlight them at the top of the Details section
2. Use a "⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES" header
3. List all breaking changes and their impact
4. Provide migration steps if applicable

### Dependencies Updates

When updating dependencies:

1. List all updated packages
2. Include version changes (from -> to)
3. Highlight any breaking changes
4. Mention any required follow-up actions

### Documentation Updates

When updating documentation:

1. List all modified documents
2. Summarize key changes
3. Include before/after examples for significant changes
4. Mention any required updates in related documents

## Best Practices

1. **Clarity**:

   - Use clear, professional language
   - Avoid jargon unless necessary
   - Explain acronyms on first use

2. **Completeness**:

   - Include all relevant information
   - Don't assume reader knowledge
   - Link to additional resources when helpful

3. **Formatting**:

   - Use proper markdown syntax
   - Include code blocks with proper language tags
   - Use headers for organization
   - Use lists for multiple items

4. **Review**:
   - Double-check all links work
   - Verify code examples are correct
   - Ensure all sections are filled
   - Check for typos and formatting issues
