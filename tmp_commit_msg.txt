refactor(rule): further reduce test case duplication with additional helpers

Add helper functions to consolidate repeated patterns in test data creation:
- createValidAccreditationResultEvent for valid accreditation events
- createExpiredAccreditationResultEvent for expired accreditation events
- createMassIdWithActorAccreditation for single actor test builders
- createMassIdWithMultipleActorAccreditations for multiple actor builders
- createMassIdAuditWithLinkEvent for LINK event creation

This reduces the file by 118 lines and addresses remaining SonarCloud
duplication warnings by eliminating repeated accreditation event configurations
and test data builder patterns.
