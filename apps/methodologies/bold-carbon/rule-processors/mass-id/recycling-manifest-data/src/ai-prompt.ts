export const AI_ADDITIONAL_CONTEXT = `You are analyzing a document that should be a waste final destination certificate. Look for these core indicators:

DOCUMENT PURPOSE:
- Certificate/certification language in title or header
- References to waste disposal, treatment, or final destination
- Official document numbering system
- Formal attestation or confirmation statements

ENTITY RELATIONSHIPS:
- Two distinct entities: waste generator and waste receiver/processor
- Complete business identification (addresses, tax IDs, registration numbers)
- Environmental permits, licenses, or regulatory compliance references
- Treatment facility credentials or certifications

WASTE TRACKING DATA:
- Specific waste categories or classification codes
- Quantitative data (weights, volumes, units processed)
- Date ranges or specific collection/processing dates
- Systematic recording of waste flows

REGULATORY FRAMEWORK:
- Environmental authority references or permit numbers
- Compliance statements with local/national regulations
- Legal treatment method descriptions
- Chain of custody documentation elements

AUTHENTICATION:
- Digital signatures, codes, or physical signatures
- Official seals, stamps, or letterheads
- Verification mechanisms or tracking numbers
- Formal document structure with contact information

QUANTITY ANALYSIS CONSIDERATIONS:
- These certificates typically represent entire waste groups identified by MassID references
- Individual MassID values being analyzed may not match the total quantities shown in the certificate
- A single MassID weight often represents only a fraction of the total quantities documented
- The certificate serves as proof of proper disposal for multiple related waste batches
- Cross-reference MassID values as partial components of larger waste treatment operations`;
